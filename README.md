# Neighborhood-map

This project displays a map of 5 locations of my interest in the Boston area of Massachusetts. It uses the Google maps API, the Knockout js library for the list of places where they can be filtered by name and at the same time the map will refresh with the filtered places. By clicking on the side bar list of 'Places in Massachusetts' or clicking on the markers on the map, an information window shows the name, address, and a little description of the place.

The app can be run double clicking the index.html once downloaded and following the above instructions:
1. Download the app as a zip
2. Uncompress the zip into a folder (if you're already running a localhost inside the localhost folder and open the index file on your browser with the localhost in front of it )
3. In a terminal go to the folder
4. On linux run this commands in two differents windows: 1. python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 2. ngrok 8080 (copy the address that return this command into your browser)
